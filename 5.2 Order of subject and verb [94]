<h1>5.2 Order of subject and verb</h1>
<h2 id="relevant-postag-codes-syntactic-relation-labels">Relevant postag
codes / syntactic relation labels</h2>
<p><strong>Syntactic label:</strong> The subject is annotated as SBJ and
the main predicate of the sentence receives the label PRED. If the verb
is in a subordinate clause, its relation reflects its function to its
linguistic parent.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ὁ παρʼ ἐμὲ ἐκλήμπτωρ ἐπʼ ἐμβάσει ἐστίν·<br>
ho par’ emè eklḗmptōr ep embásei estín.<br>
<em>My contractor is on (our) doorstep.</em><br>

</ol>
<p>In Ancient Greek, the subject is often omitted in sentences where it
can be understood from the the personal ending of the verb and the
context, e.g.&nbsp;if the subject has already been mentioned in a previous
sentence and is not changed.</p>
<p>In the literary treebanked corpus, the number of sentences in which
the subject is explicitly mentioned is higher than the number of
sentences where it has been omitted (60% vs.&nbsp;40%). In the PapyGreek
corpus, sentences with explicitly mentioned SBJ are far fewer - only 23%
of all sentences. In Duke-nlp the ratio is also in favour of omitting
the subject.</p>
<p>When the subject is present in the sentence, it is nearly twice as
common for it to be placed before than after the verb:</p>
