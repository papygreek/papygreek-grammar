<h1>5.2 Order of subject and verb</h1>
<p>In Ancient Greek, the subject is often omitted in sentences where it
can be understood from the context. In the literary treebanked corpus,
however, the number of sentences in which the subject is explicitly
mentioned is higher than the number of sentences where it has been
omitted (60% vs.&nbsp;40%). In the PapyGreek corpus, sentences with
explicitly mentioned SBJ are far fewer - only 23% of all sentences. In
Duke-nlp the ratio is also in favour of omitting the subject.</p>

common for it to be placed before than after the verb: *:search-</p>
