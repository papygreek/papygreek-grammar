<h1>3.2 Voice</h1>
<p>Ancient Greek had three morphologically distinct voice
categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Active</li>
<li>Middle</li>
<li>Passive</li>
</ol>
<p>In the present and perfect tenses, the <em>middle forms serve for
both middle and passive voices</em>, therefore they are sometimes said
to present <em>medio-passive</em> voice, which also has its own
annotation.</p>
<p>Verbal grammatical category of voice pertains to the relationship
between syntactic roles (subject, direct object) and semantic roles
(agent, patient, experiencer, beneficiary, recipient). (VIITE <span class="citation" data-cites="emde2019">Emde Boas et al. (2019)</span>
?)</p>
<p>Voice is connected to the notion of transitivity: transitive verbs
(that take an object or complement) can be used in the passive voice,
but intransitive verbs (that do not take object or complement) usually
cannot appear in the passive. (VIITE <span class="citation" data-cites="emde2019">Emde Boas et al. (2019)</span> ?)</p>
