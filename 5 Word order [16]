<ul>
<li>Short intro about word order in general?</li>
<li>Word order phenomena in PapyGreek are viewed in parallel and
contrast with the results from 3 other treebanked corpora: literary
prose (AGDT minus verse authors, plus Gorman’s trees), PROIEL’s New
Testament, and the automatically annotated corpus of documentary papyri
Duke-nlp (minus lists and labels which are not of much interest to
treebanking).</li>
<li>The following chapters are data-driven and aim to present the
phenomena and their distributions in our corpus.</li>
<li>The queries from which the results are obtained are performed
primarily in the KTB platform (Yordanova-Nanev, forthcoming). Where
possible, links to comparable queries in the PapyGreek platform are
given, but the results may vary.</li>
