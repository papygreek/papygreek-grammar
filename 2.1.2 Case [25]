<h1>2.1.2 Case</h1>
<h2 id="relevant-postag-code">Relevant postag code</h2>
<p><strong>Position in postag string: 8th</strong></p>
<p>letters: n (nominative), g (genitive), d (dative), a (accusative), v
(vocative)</p>
<p>Example: n-s—m<strong>n</strong>- (noun, singular, masculine,
<strong>nominative</strong>)</p>
<h2 id="number-of-cases">Number of cases</h2>
<p>In Ancient Greek, there are five cases: nominative, genitive, dative,
accusative, and vocative. This is relatively rare among the world
languages, since most of the languages using casemarking have either two
cases or more than five, as can be seen from <span class="citation" data-cites="iggesen2013">Iggesen (2013)</span>. The case endings are
added to the noun stems; what these endings are is determined by the
declension the noun follows.</p>
<p>In the <em>dual</em> there are only two forms: one for nominative,
accusative and vocative, the other for genitive and dative.</p>
<p>Although Greek lost the original PIE locative case (“place where”)
merging it into the dative, some local endings remain in early
literature, especially in Homer. These endings are (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="kaegi2007">Kaegi (2007)</span>, p.&nbsp;27):</p>
<ul>
<li>-θεν denoting whence: οἴκοθεν ‘from home’</li>
<li>-ι and –θι in the singular, -σι in the plural denoting where: οἴκοι
‘at home’</li>
<li>-δε, -σε, -ζε denoting whither: οἴκαδε ‘home(ward)’</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-syncretism">Case syncretism</h2>
<p>As per the definition of <span class="citation" data-cites="baerman2013">Baerman and Brown (2013)</span>, we can
identify case syncretism when a single inflected form corresponds to two
or more case functions. In Greek, this happens in certain instances both
with core and non-core cases.</p>
<p>In core cases (nominative and accusative), the neuter gender
represents case syncretism in all nominal declensions and in singular
and plural.</p>
<ul>
<li>τὸ δῶρον (tò dôron) <em>gift.sg</em> is a second declension neuter
noun form <strong>sg.nom=sg.acc</strong></li>
<li>τὰ δῶρα (tà dôra) <em>gift.pl</em> is a second declension neuter
noun form <strong>pl.nom=pl.acc</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The nominative and the vocative cases are very often the same form
(and always in plural), see <a data-link-newtab="" href="/smyth/body.1_div1.2_div2.2.html" data-url="smyth/body.1_div1.2_div2.2.html">Smyth §201,
§202, §204</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally other forms have developed so that they signify several
cases, like in the Attic second declension words <strong>(Attic second
declension is not used in papyri, though)</strong>. Example of this is ὁ
νεώς (ho neṓs) <em>temple</em>, where</p>
<ul>
<li>νεώς <strong>sg.nom=pl.acc</strong></li>
<li>νεῴ <strong>sg.dat=pl.nom=pl.voc</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, note the forms νεώ (sg.gen) and νεῴς (pl.dat); the presence
or absence of the iota adscript/subscript plays a vital role in
identifying cases, and the iota adsript is not necessarily written in
papyri, but is usually added as a subscript to the edition’s transcript.
Iota subscript is never written in the papyri.</p>
<p>Third declension (i/e and υ type) has the same form for plural
nominative and accusative</p>
<ul>
<li>πόλεις (póleis) <em>city.pl</em> / πήχεις (pḗkheis)
<em>forearm.pl</em> <strong>pl.nom=pl.acc</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, the definite article or other modifiers may help to
identify the intended case, if present: αἱ (hai.f.pl.nom), τάς
(tás.f.pl.acc) and οἱ (hoi.m.pl.nom), τούς (toús.m.pl.acc).</p>

<ul>
<li>Many more clashing forms can be found in papyri due to pronunciation
and misspellings (e.g.&nbsp;πόλεις/πόλις) and not writing out the iota
subscript (sometimes adscript is used, also hypercorrectly).</li>
<li>vocative in documentary papyri: still in use occasionally, but
replaced by the nominative also (examples?)</li>
<li>local endings not really used in documentary papyri? They are found,
e.g.&nbsp;in p.babatha.5 word 2-18 (αὐτόθεν: from the same place; 102 hits,
ὁπόθεν only 2 hits)</li>
<li>use of cases goes into new directions in time, e.g.&nbsp;the genitive and
dative can replace one another (&gt; syntax, use of cases?)</li>
<li>Merger of 1st and 3rd declension, e.g., was very significant for the
development of the declension system in Medieval and Modern Greek (see
Horrocks 2010, 120–121+)</li>
