<h1>1.2 Vowels</h1>
<p>Ancient Greek had a rich vowel inventory. During its very long
history, it had many changes, but it had long and short vowels (vowel
quantity) and diphthongs in various forms and developments until the
Roman period, when vowel quantity vanished, and diphthongs developed
into monophthongs. In the Classical period, the Ancient Greek vowel
inventory still included six to seven vowel qualities, depending on the
precise developmental stage. These include the high front rounded vowel
/y/, which is rare cross-linguistically. There was also still a
diphthong /oi/. In the previous stages of the languages, there were four
diphthongs, /ei/, /ai/, /oi/ and /ou/; /ei/, /ai/ and /ou/ were, in
time, monopthingised and became /i/, /e/ and /u/, respectively. /oi/ had
the same fate but later, when it during the Roman period merged first
with /Ã¸/, which then developed into /y/. This variation has some
evidence in the misspellings with /u/ and /e/ especially in Egyptian
Greek (x).</p>
