<h1>5.3 Order of object and verb</h1>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The discussion below concerns primarily direct objects, which in
Ancient Greek, for the majority of verbs, are in the accusative. Objects
in the dative are commonly indirect, although there is a class of verbs
which takes datives as obligatory complements. However, due to their
smaller overall number and in favour of reducing possible conflation of
the results, they have been omitted from the investigation.</p>
<p>While in literary prose there is a substantial variation in the
ordering of object and verb, with instances of <em>verb-object</em> and
<em>object-verb</em> being roughly equally common, in papyri there is a
strong preference for verb-initial ordering, especially in
legal/administrative documents (Duke-nlp).</p>
