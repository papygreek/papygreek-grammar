<h1>5.3 Order of object and verb</h1>
<h2 id="relevant-postag-codes-syntactic-relation-labels">Relevant postag
codes / syntactic relation labels</h2>
<p><strong>Syntactic label:</strong> The object (direct or indirect) is
annotated as OBJ and the main predicate of the sentence receives the
label PRED. If the verb is in a subordinate clause, its relation
reflects its function to its linguistic parent.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ἀσπάζομαι τὴν ἀδελφήν μου Ταοννῶφριν καὶ τὴν (θυγ(α)τ̣(έρα))
Βελλαίου.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The discussion below concerns primarily direct objects, which in
Ancient Greek, for the majority of verbs, are in the accusative. Objects
in the dative are commonly indirect, although there is a class of verbs
which takes datives as obligatory complements. However, due to their
smaller overall number and in favour of reducing possible conflation of
the results, they have been omitted from the investigation.</p>
<p>While in literary prose there is a substantial variation in the
ordering of object and verb, with instances of <em>verb-object</em> and
<em>object-verb</em> being roughly equally common, in papyri there is a
strong preference for verb-initial ordering, especially in
legal/administrative documents. This is confirmed both in our corpus and
on the scale of Duke-nlp.</p>
