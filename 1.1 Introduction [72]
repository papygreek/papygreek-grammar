<h1>1.1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The rich material of documentary papyri found in Greek in Egypt
offers us a glimpse into the spoken level of the language, in the form
of nonstandard orthography i.e.&nbsp;misspellings. These come in several
forms, some being mere scribal errors that, for instance, repeat the
last letter of the previous word as the first letter of the next one, or
use the same vowel in all syllables of the word – a simple lapse of
thought in the sometimes repetitive task of writing sales documents from
model texts, for example. Many of the misspellings, however, reflect the
actual phonetic level of the word, and consequently, examples of the
Greek phonological development found their way in the texts at a time
when many of the phoneme changes were still in process – this is a
typical element of any variation that eventually leads to language
change. In many instances of language change, the sounds changing can be
divided into unconditioned and conditioned, i.e.&nbsp;free variation and
context-dependent, and this is a major issue for understanding the
(often phonetically-based) nonstandard orthography of Greek in the
papyrological documents (Campbell 2013: 14-16).</p>
