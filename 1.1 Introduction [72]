<h1>1.1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The rich material of documentary papyri found in Greek in Egypt
offers us a glimpse into the spoken level of the language, in the form
of nonstandard orthography i.e.&nbsp;misspellings. These come in several
forms, some being mere scribal errors that, for instance, repeat the
last letter of the previous word as the first letter of the next one, or
use the same vowel in all syllables of the word – a simple lapse of
thought in the sometimes repetitive task of writing sales documents from
model texts, for example. Many of the misspellings, however, reflect the
actual phonetic level of the word, and consequently, examples of the
Greek phonological development found their way in the texts at a time
when many of the phoneme changes were still in process – this is a
typical element of any variation that eventually leads to language
change. In many instances of language change, the sounds changing can be
divided into unconditioned and conditioned, i.e.&nbsp;free variation and
context-dependent, and this is a major issue for understanding the
(often phonetically-based) nonstandard orthography of Greek in the
papyrological documents <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell2013">Campbell (2013)</span>: 14-16.</p>
<p>The most frequent examples of Greek internal phonological
developments concern iotacism, which caused the raising and fronting of
the Greek front and close vowels η, ει, υ, οι (/e/e̝, ei, y, oi/ to /i/),
and fricativisation, which concerns the development of the
dento-alveolar and bilabial plosives δ, β, ϕ, γ /d, b, pʰ, g/ to
fricatives /ð, β, f, ɣ (e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="horrocks2010">Horrocks (2010)</span>: 160-180; <span class="citation" data-cites="teodorsson1977">Teodorsson (1977)</span>).
However, a substantial amount of the misspellings in Egyptian Greek,
which covers the majority of all papyrological documentary material,
have their basis in the language contact situation with Egyptian.</p>
<p>Through the influence of the writer’s linguistic background, some of
these misspellings show the effect of the spoken level of Egyptian
rather than Greek. For instance, some nonstandard spellings offer
examples of iotacism from a different perspective than can be seen in
those examples caused by Greek internal development. In the misspellings
resulting from the impact of Egyptian phonology, the nonstandard vowels
often have some coarticulatory effect from the adjacent consonants,
i.e.&nbsp;have adapted to the place or manner of them (<span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2017">Dahlgren (2017)</span>: 100-113; 130-133;
159-161); <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren">(<strong>dahlgren?</strong>)</span> in prep. a).
This is different from those resulting from the Greek vowel raising,
because the latter examples appear in free variation, unconcerned with
any phonemic environment. This obviously does not mean that Greek
internal iotacism was not in place in Egyptian Greek: according to
Gignac (1991: 187), it was accelerated in Egyptian Greek because of
fewer front vowel distinctions in Egyptian-Coptic than in Greek.
Underdifferentiation of Greek vowel qualities, therefore, was partly
responsible for much of the vowel variation, including that related to
iotacism.</p>
