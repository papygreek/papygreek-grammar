<h1>1.1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The rich material of documentary papyri found in Greek in Egypt
offers us a glimpse into the spoken level of the language, in the form
of nonstandard orthography i.e.&nbsp;misspellings. These come in several
forms, some being mere scribal errors that, for instance, repeat the
last letter of the previous word as the first letter of the next one, or
use the same vowel in all syllables of the word – a simple lapse of
thought in the sometimes repetitive task of writing sales documents from
model texts, for example. Many of the misspellings, however, reflect the
actual phonetic level of the word, and consequently, examples of the
Greek phonological development have found their way in the texts at a
time when many of the phoneme changes were still in process – this is a
typical element of any variation that eventually leads to language
change. In many instances of language change, the sounds changing can be
divided into unconditioned and conditioned, i.e.&nbsp;free variation and
context-dependent, and this is a major issue for understanding the
(often phonetically-based) nonstandard orthography of Greek in the
papyrological documents, see <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell2013">Campbell (2013)</span>, p.&nbsp;14-16.</p>
<p>The most frequent examples of Greek internal phonological
developments concern iotacism, which caused the raising and fronting of
the Greek front and close vowels η, ει, υ, οι (/e/e̝, ei, y, oi/ to /i/),
and fricativisation, which concerns the development of the
dento-alveolar and bilabial plosives δ, β, ϕ, γ /d, b, pʰ, g/ to
fricatives /ð, β, f, ɣ/ (e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="horrocks2010">Horrocks (2010)</span>, p.&nbsp;160-180; <span class="citation" data-cites="teodorsson1977">Teodorsson (1977)</span>).
However, a substantial amount of the misspellings in Egyptian Greek,
which covers the majority of all papyrological documentary material,
have their basis in the language contact situation with Egyptian.</p>
<p>Through the influence of the writer’s linguistic background, some of
these misspellings show the effect of the spoken level of Egyptian
rather than Greek. For instance, some nonstandard spellings offer
examples of iotacism from a different perspective than can be seen in
those examples caused by Greek internal development. In the misspellings
resulting from the impact of Egyptian phonology, the nonstandard vowels
often have some coarticulatory effect from the adjacent consonants,
i.e.&nbsp;have adapted to the place or manner of them (<span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2017">Dahlgren (2017)</span>, pp.&nbsp;100-113; 130-133;
159-161); <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgreninprep_a">Dahlgren
(In preparation A)</span>). This is different from those resulting from
the Greek vowel raising, because the latter examples appear in free
variation, unconcerned with any phonemic environment. This obviously
does not mean that Greek internal iotacism was not in place in Egyptian
Greek: according to <span class="citation" data-cites="gignac1976">Gignac (1976)</span>, p.&nbsp;47 and <span class="citation" data-cites="gignac1991">Gignac (1991)</span>, p.&nbsp;187,
it was accelerated in Egyptian Greek because there were fewer front
vowel distinctions in Egyptian-Coptic than in Greek. But because of
this, and the frequent coarticulatory effect of consonants on vowels,
‘iotacism’ was perhaps not the same phenomenon for the Egyptian L2 Greek
writer. Underdifferentiation of Greek vowel qualities was partly
responsible for much of the vowel variation, including that related to
iotacism.</p>
<p>As will be seen, there is some multicausality to the Greek production
in Egypt, with various possible routes behind some of the nonstandard
spellings, case syncretism frequently playing a part in the equation
(see <span class="citation" data-cites="baerman2013">Baerman and Brown
(2013)</span> for more on case syncretism, also related to Indo-European
languages). The different types of variation caused by internal
phonological and morphosyntactic developments and/or language contact
are, therefore, dealt with in separate sections.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek nonstandard phono-orthographic variation in
papyrological documents has first been studied in <span class="citation" data-cites="gignac1976">Gignac (1976)</span> and later in <span class="citation" data-cites="gignac1991">Gignac (1991)</span>.
Furthermore, <span class="citation" data-cites="girgis1966">Girgis
(1966)</span> studied the phonetic reasons behind misspellings in Greek
loanwords in Coptic, accentuating the effect of consonants on vowels and
the general underdifferentiation of Greek vowel qualities by Egyptian
writers. These studies give all the orthographic variants and the
consonantal surroundings in which vowel variation most frequently
appears, with direct comparison to Coptic phonology revealed in <span class="citation" data-cites="gignac1991">Gignac (1991)</span>. The
connection to Egyptian-Coptic phonology has also been noted by <span class="citation" data-cites="horrocks2010">Horrocks (2010)</span>,
p.&nbsp;112, largely following <span class="citation" data-cites="teodorsson1977">Teodorsson (1977)</span>, with examples
concerning the most frequent phenomena. <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2017">Dahlgren (2017)</span> provides a detailed
phonological-phonetic analysis of the variation in one corpus,
Narmouthis Greek ostraca.</p>
<p>The relation of the misspellings to societal bilingualism in Egypt is
discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2016">Dahlgren
(2016)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2022">Dahlgren
(2022)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgreninprep_b">Dahlgren (In preparation B)</span>. The
Coptic phonological system, which is relevant related to the
misspellings of Greek in Egypt, is discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren2020">Dahlgren (2020)</span>. The connection between
(phonetically-based) misspellings and Greek verb semantic confusion is
discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgrenleiwo2020">Dahlgren and Leiwo (2020)</span>. A
statistical analysis of contact-induced variation in Egyptian Greek is
given in <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgren_etal2022">Dahlgren,
Keersmaekers, and Stolk (2022)</span>, and a semi-statistical analysis
related to vowel quality variation adjacent to Egyptian Greek /r/ and
stress-related variation between /o/ and /u/ are offered in <span class="citation" data-cites="henrikssonetal_digi">Henriksson, Dahlgren,
and Vierros (Accepted)</span>. Finally, iotacism in Egyptian Greek as a
separate phenomenon is discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="dahlgreninprep_a">Dahlgren (In preparation A)</span>.</p>
