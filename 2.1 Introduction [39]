<h1>2.1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Nouns and other nominal forms, i.e.&nbsp;articles, adjectives,
participles, numerals and pronouns, express <em>number, gender,</em> and
<em>grammatical case</em>. Nouns usually have only one gender, but
number and case vary according to the syntactic function the word has in
the sentence and according the referent. Articles, adjectives,
participles and pronouns, on the other hand, agree with their head and
have three different forms for the genders (in certain cases only two or
one).</p>
<p>In Greek, the subjects and objects (dependants) are attached with the
marking of being the subject or the object, thus we can say that Greek
is a <strong>dependent marking language</strong> (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="nichols2013">Nichols and Bickel
(2013)</span>). Each noun has a <strong>stem</strong> onto which the
case marking is attached according to the declension type (see below);
Greek is a <strong>suffixing language</strong> in nominal morphology
(see <span class="citation" data-cites="dryer2013">Dryer (2013)</span>).
Number is embedded in the case marking. The noun stems can have
variation (grades, <em>Ablaut</em>).</p>
